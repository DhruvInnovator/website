🌊 **One of the greatest gifts you have is the ability to help those in need for a helping hand costs nothing, but it can make a priceless impact on the world.** 🌊

In a collaborative effort, the **Rotaract Club of Galgotias Educational Institutions**, in association with the **Rotaract Club of SGGSCC** and the **Rotaract Club of YOUNG SOUVENIRS**, jointly presented ✨**Flood Relief Drive**🤝 - a Mega Food, Clothes, Ration Kit Donation Drive.

We proudly presented **"Restoring Hope Together,"** an event dedicated to providing immediate relief and support to the resilient community of Mayur Vihar Phase 1, who had been affected by devastating floods. 🤲✨

The event took place on **18th July 2023**, starting at **1:30 pm**. We served a crowd of **800+ flood victims**. The team of Rotaractors halted at different stops and donated **150+ Clothes and Shoes**, **600+ Food servings**, **400+ Biscuits, Chips, Frooti, Water Bottles**, **50+ Sanitary Pads**, several **Ration kits**, and many more such items to provide humanitarian aid to those affected.

🏵️**Together we extended our hands and hearts to those in need.** We successfully held this mega food, clothing, and ration kit donation drive. Every contribution mattered to us as we strived to bring comfort, nourishment, and a glimmer of hope to the lives affected by this natural calamity.🏵️

We united, shoulder to shoulder, and became the beacon of hope for those struggling in the aftermath of the floods. Together, we helped restore faith, rebuild lives, and make a lasting impact. 🤲✨
