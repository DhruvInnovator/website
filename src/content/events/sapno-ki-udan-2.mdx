We proudly present the groundbreaking campaign, “Sapno ki Udaan 2.0.” A joint project with Rotaract Club of Indirapuram Pariwar. Our aim is to distribute sanitary pads and raise awareness about menstrual hygiene among women who lack access to this basic necessity.

With unwavering determination, our club organized “Sapno ki Udaan 2.0” in two phases, held in November and April. The impact of this initiative has been nothing short of remarkable, as numerous individuals joined forces with us to generously donate pads and contribute funds, resulting in an impressive collection of 7500 pads.

The transformative power of “Sapno ki Udaan 2.0” has revolutionized the lives of women in our community.
- By addressing the stigma surrounding menstruation head-on, this event has created an environment of open dialogue, shattering the barriers that have silenced women for far too long.
- Both participants and the women we have reached out to have experienced a powerful transformation, embracing their right to proper menstrual hygiene without shame or hesitation.

At the Rotaract Club of Galgotias Educational Institutions,
- we believe that access to menstrual hygiene products is a fundamental right for all women.
- Through our campaign, we strive to empower women by providing them with the resources they need to manage their periods with dignity.
- By working together, we can break the taboos surrounding menstruation and create a society where every woman can thrive without hindrance.

Join us in our mission to make a difference in the lives of women. Together, we can bring about a positive change, one sanitary pad at a time.
