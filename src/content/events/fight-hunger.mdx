# Fight Hunger 3.0

The **Rotaract Club of Galgotias Educational Institutions** proudly presented **Fight Hunger 3.0** 🍜, a remarkable food drive aimed at uniting to feed the future, one meal at a time. This event ignited a collective effort to combat the pressing issue of hunger that plagues our communities. 🎉

On **16th July 2023**, we initiated this campaign with a simple yet wonderful aim of feeding the needy people around us by providing free food packets. The event was a huge success and ended with many peaceful smiles and many great connections. 💐

We want to express our heartfelt gratitude to all who joined us on our impactful food drive! Your generosity has made a real difference in the fight against hunger. Together, we're nourishing lives and spreading hope throughout our community. Your support is truly appreciated. 🥂

🌟**"Together we Eradicate hunger, ignite hope."**🌟
