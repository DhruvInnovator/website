# Joyful Congregation
Joyful Congregation took place on Satuday, 9th December, 2023, at City Park , Alpha 2 , Greater Noida .The Fellowship was organised to develop a healthy and family-like atmosphere for all the new as well as the older members.

Using the games and activities organised by the Club as a staircase, everyone could feel the bonds strengthening and the atmosphere becoming cozier. Everyone, divided into their respective teams showed a coordinated effort in the activities like dumb-charades, treasure hunt etc. This event brought together the whole community of Rotaract and helped us to develop confidence to communicate with all the other members and to work efficiently in the upcoming projects.
